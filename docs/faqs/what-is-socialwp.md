# What is Social?

Social is a WordPress plugin that helps you create a customizable page for sharing important links with your audience. This page, called a link in bio, can be accessed through your social media bios on various platforms. With Social, you can make it easier for your audience to discover your work, brand, or business.

Social's free plan comes with plenty of features to help you create and share your link in bio page. If you want to take your link in bio page to the next level, you can [upgrade to a paid plan](https://socialwp.io/#pricing) that fits your needs.

After [setting up your link in bio page](/category/links) and adding [all the links you want to share](/tutorial-basics/links/creating-your-first-link), copy the unique URL for your page and share it with your audience on social media and other platforms. From then on, you can simply update the links on your link in bio page whenever you want, without having to change the link in your bio again. It's that easy!

# Creating your first link

Now that you've downloaded and installed Social on your site, it's time to create your first link.

## Steps

1. In the **"Links"** section of the Social Editor, click `Add new link`.
2. Give your link a **title**. This title will appear on your bio link as a link button later on.
3. Add a **URL** to your link.

Your newly created link will now be visible on your bio link.

:::note Troubleshooting

Sometimes, a link doesn't show up on your bio link. This can be due to the following:

- You haven't entered a valid title.
- You haven't entered a valid URL.

Social informs you if this is the case. An orange info badge â“˜ will appear on the top right of your link.

Social icons allow you to link to all of your social media accounts in a compact way. They'll show in the footer of a link in bio page.

## Steps

1. In the Social Editor, hit the `Settings` button in the top left navigation.
2. Scroll down until you see the **icons** section. Click on the `Add icon` button.
3. In the search bar, type in the name of the icon you want to use and select it from the list.
4. In the next field, enter the URL to your profile.
5. Once you've entered all the information, click on the `Add icon` button to save your changes.

You can reorder social icons by holding on the vertical three dots `â‹®` on the left side of an icon.

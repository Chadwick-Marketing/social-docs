To give you more control over the appearance of your page, our Pro plan offers the option to remove the Social badge that appears at the bottom of the page.

## Steps

1. In the Social Editor, hit the `Settings` button in the top left navigation.
2. Scroll down until you see the **badge** section.
3. Click on the toggle next to `Hide the Social badge`. This will remove the badge from your bio link page.

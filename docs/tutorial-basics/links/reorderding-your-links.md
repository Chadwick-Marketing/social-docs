# Reordering your links

If you have many links on your bio link, it's a good idea to sort them. Social allows you to reorder links using drag-and-drop.

## Steps

1. In the **`Links`** section of the Social Editor, click and hold on the vertical three dots `â‹®` on the left side of a link.
2. Move the link up or down to the desired location.

The link automatically snaps in place.

If you want to precisely sort and categorize your links, you can use the **Header** block available under the `Explore` button.

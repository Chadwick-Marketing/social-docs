# Removing your links

Sometimes, removing old links from your bio link is necessary to replace them with new content.

:::info

Deleting a link automatically removes the respective click data.

:::

## Steps

1. In the **`Links`** section of the Social Editor, click on the trash icon `ðŸ—‘` located at the top right of a link.
2. Click the `Delete` button to confirm that you want to remove the link. This action can't be undone.

Your link is now removed.

:::tip

You can also temporarily hide a link, without deleting it. [Learn more](./changing-the-visibility-of-your-links) about toggling the visibility of your links.

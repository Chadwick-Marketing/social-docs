# Changing the visibility of your links

Social allows you to temporarily hide links without deleting them. You can alway decide to show them again, without losing any click data.

## Steps

1. In the **"Links"** section of the Social Editor, click on the blue toggle on the right side of a link.
2. The toggle will turn grey. The link is now hidden.

If you ever decide to show your link again, click on the grey toggle. It will turn blue and the link will appear again.
